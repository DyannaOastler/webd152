<p>My favorite beverage is Cabernet Sauvignon. It is a red wine. If you drink in moderation, it has benefits. It is full of antioxidants and could enhance heart health by improving your cholesterol and blood pressure, reduce risk of cognitive decline, and strengthen bones in older women. I really like to drink a glass of Cabernet during dinnertime, especially if it pairs with steak that is cooked rare.</p>
